# uCard Project: Hack WashU 2022

# Contributers:
Tyler Kay, Moises Lopez, Trey Alexander, and Evelyn Lawrie

# Organization: Chapman University 

# Project Basis:
Our goal was to create a virtual interactable business card. It would allow individuals to upload information to an app and lookup and store a database of information from other users. We wanted to create a simple platform to minimize the environmental and organizational impact of paper business cards, as printing and keeping track of cards from others can decrease the desire to maintain someone's contact information. 

# Current Progress:
We created a proof of concept for this project, including a database of business cards and separate UI for storing cards. We created functionality of a database to store business cards and ability to enter in your information to create your own card. This created card gets stored in the database, holding information for a user's name, email, job title, company, and phone number. The database is accessable through the inspector window command line, while we ran into errors that we were unable to resolve when attempting to print to the webpage. 

# Future Ideas:
The end goal of this project would be creating a mobile application to allow phones to share business card information between each other. A person's list of received business cards would be printed on the homepage, as well as the ability to create and edit their own card. This would also contain buttons to send and receive cards. The scope of the project and infamiliarity with app development provided obstacles to following through with this idea.
